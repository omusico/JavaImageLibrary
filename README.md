JavaImageLibrary
================  

A friendly wrapper around OpenCV for general Image processing (Based on Python's PIL imaging Library) 

If you're looking at this from SPC, I'll commit the core tomorrow. In the meantime, you can checkout http://effbot.org/imagingbook/ if you want to get an idea of what the API looks like. 

The goal is to make a 'middle ground' library. Something more powerful than ImageJ, but less complex than full blown OpenCV. 

Also, it's in shambles, but the Panelizomaticizer repo has the shell code if you want to take a look at it. A lot of that is reused.
